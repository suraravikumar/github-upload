#My aim in this script is weather my startegy 1 (interest wave strategy) is effective or not with respect of strategy 2 (StandardPromotion) by using 2 sample T test 
View(Promotion)
# i am going to change my column names 
colnames(Promotion)<-c("Credit","Promotion.Type","InterestRateWaiver","StandardPromotion")
View(Promotion) # to verify my column names are changed or not
attach(Promotion)
# for normality test, null hypo(H0) is : Normally distributed, alternative hypo (H1)is : Not normally distributed
shapiro.test(InterestRateWaiver)
# p-value = 0.2246 >0.05 so p high null fly => It follows normal distribution
shapiro.test(StandardPromotion)
# p-value = 0.1916 >0.05 so p high null fly => It follows normal distribution
# so both strategy are normally distributed 
# because my external conditions are not same as per flow chart should do Variance test
# for any statistics test it should have both null and alternative hypo here H0 : Variance is equal, H1 : Variance is unequal 
var.test(InterestRateWaiver,StandardPromotion)
# p-value = 0.653 > 0.05 so p high null fly => Equal variances
# because of equal variances,as per flow chart should do 2 sample T test
# H0 : mean of strategy 1 = mean of strategy 2, H1 : means are not equal.
# 2 sample T Test

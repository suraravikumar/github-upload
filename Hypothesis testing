# for normality test, null hypo(H0) is : Normally distributed, alternative hypo (H1)is : Not normally distributed
shapiro.test(InterestRateWaiver)
# p-value = 0.2246 >0.05 so p high null fly => It follows normal distribution
shapiro.test(StandardPromotion)
# p-value = 0.1916 >0.05 so p high null fly => It follows normal distribution
# so both strategy are normally distributed 
# because my external conditions are not same as per flow chart should do Variance test
# for any statistics test it should have both null and alternative hypo here H0 : Variance is equal, H1 : Variance is unequal 
var.test(InterestRateWaiver,StandardPromotion)
# p-value = 0.653 > 0.05 so p high null fly => Equal variances
# because of equal variances,as per flow chart should do 2 sample T test
# H0 : mean of strategy 1 = mean of strategy 2, H1 : means are not equal.
# 2 sample T Test
t.test(InterestRateWaiver,StandardPromotion, alternative = "two.sided",conf.level = 0.95,correct = TRUE)
# p-value = 0.02423 < 0.05 so p low null go  => means are not equal (H1)
# so my means are not equal again i should perform the test with changing alternative = "two.sided" to alternative = "greater"
# Null Hypothesis -> (InterestRateWaiver-StandardPromotion) <= 0
# Alternative Hypothesis ->  (InterestRateWaiver-StandardPromotion) > 0
t.test(InterestRateWaiver,StandardPromotion,alternative = "greater",var.equal = T)
# p-value = 0.01211 < 0.05 => p low null go => accept alternate hypothesis
# InterestRateWaiver better strategy than StandardPromotion

# instead of checking each item wise use pairs.panel for consolidated values
# to use pairs.panel should install psych package
pairs.panels(Cars)
# if you observe co relation value between VOL and WT  is "1.00" which means undesirable property, because presence of multicollinearity

# or we can find the all possible correlation by applying correlation function to entire data set.

cor(Cars)

# values displying by pairs.panels(Cars) & cor(Cars) are same but for better visualtion and better understanding use pairs.panels(Cars)

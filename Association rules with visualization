# Different Ways of visualization Rules
plot(arules)
# I understood that my lift ratio is increasing with respective of colour so darker the colour means higher the lift ratio 
# my support values are falling under [0.002 to 0.009]
# Confidence values are falling under [0.6 to 0.85 or can go 0.90 having 1 observation]

# Another way of visualization
